## Blockchain-Based Voting System
Welcome to the Blockchain-Based Voting System project! This repository is part of the Winter of Blockchain 2024 open-source initiative, aimed at creating a secure and transparent voting system leveraging blockchain technology.

# Overview
The Blockchain-Based Voting System is designed to provide a decentralized, tamper-proof method for conducting elections. By utilizing blockchain technology, this system ensures that votes are recorded transparently and immutably, preventing fraud and enhancing trust in the voting process.

# Features
Decentralization: Votes are recorded on a distributed ledger, eliminating the need for a central authority.   
Transparency: All votes are visible on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.   
Security: Blockchain's cryptographic features ensure that votes cannot be altered once they are recorded.   
Anonymity: Voter identity is kept confidential, ensuring privacy.   
Scalability: The system is designed to handle large-scale elections efficiently.   
## Tech Stack
Backend: Solidity (Smart Contracts)   
Blockchain Platform: Ethereum   
Frontend: React.js   
Database: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)   
Development and Testing: Foundry   
Version Control: Git   

## Getting Started
