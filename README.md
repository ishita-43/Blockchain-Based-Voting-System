## Blockchain-Based Voting System
Welcome to the Blockchain-Based Voting System project! This repository is part of the Winter of Blockchain 2024 open-source initiative, aimed at creating a secure and transparent voting system leveraging blockchain technology.

# Overview
The Blockchain-Based Voting System is designed to provide a decentralized, tamper-proof method for conducting elections. By utilizing blockchain technology, this system ensures that votes are recorded transparently and immutably, preventing fraud and enhancing trust in the voting process.

# Features
Decentralization: Votes are recorded on a distributed ledger, eliminating the need for a central authority.
Transparency: All votes are visible on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
Security: Blockchain's cryptographic features ensure that votes cannot be altered once they are recorded.
Anonymity: Voter identity is kept confidential, ensuring privacy.
Scalability: The system is designed to handle large-scale elections efficiently.
Tech Stack
Backend: Solidity (Smart Contracts)
Blockchain Platform: Ethereum
Frontend: React.js
Database: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
Development Tools: Truffle, Ganache
Testing: Mocha, Chai
Version Control: Git
